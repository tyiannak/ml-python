# ml-python
This repo contains Python examples for the Machine Learning Course at the [MSc Program of AI](http://msc-ai.iit.demokritos.gr), organzied by NCSR Demokritos and University of Piraeus. 

Most examples are in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Since github does not render plotly figures, the links of this readme file are not directly to the github files but to nbviewer links ([https://nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org)). 

## Topics

### Linear Regression
[notebooks/1-linear-regression.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tyiannak/ml-python/blob/main/notebooks/1-linear-regression.ipynb) demonstrates how Gradient Descent can be used to calculate a linear regression model, for a small dataset. Also, we plot the cost function (as a 2-D function of w and b) and the path followed by the Gradient Descent iteration. 

### Logistic Regression
[notebooks/2-logistic-regression.ipyn](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tyiannak/ml-python/blob/main/notebooks/2-logistic-regression.ipynb) demonstrates how to use Gradient Ascent to train a logistic regression binary classifier using some 2D training data. It also visualizes the decision surface and the probability estimates of the classifier on the 2D feature space. 

### Bayesian / GDA classifiers, Naive Bayes, kNN

### Perceptron, SVMs

### Decision Trees, Ensembles

### Practical ML Issues

### Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
