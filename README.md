# ml-python
This repo contains Python examples for the Machine Learning Course at the [MSc Program of AI](http://msc-ai.iit.demokritos.gr), organzied by NCSR Demokritos and University of Piraeus. 

Most examples are in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Since github does not render plotly figures, the links of this readme file are not directly to the github files but to nbviewer links ([https://nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org)).
